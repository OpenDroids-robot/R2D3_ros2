# Camera Optical-Frame Yaw Fix Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Make the MuJoCo `/camera/image` look forward (nav +X) instead of 90° to the robot's left, by adding the sim-overlay yaw compensation that the URDF unification removed but never re-added.

**Architecture:** The sim overlay injects a mesh→nav **+90° yaw** at `base_footprint_to_base` (`r2d3_mujoco.urdf.xacro:29`). That yaw propagates down the whole mechanical tree to `camera_link`, so the camera's optical bore (which the MuJoCo converter takes from the `camera_optical_frame` site) points nav **+Y (left)**. The lidar/imu escape the yaw by mounting directly on `base_footprint`; the head-mounted camera cannot, so it needs a **−90° yaw compensation** in its optical frame. We add that compensation in the sim-only, both-sims-shared `depth_camera.urdf.xacro`, leaving the core `dual_rm_description` real-faithful (`camera_joint rpy="0 0 0"`). This *completes* the unification intent — commit `9a01958` correctly removed the sim-hack from the core description but forgot to add the compensation back in the overlay.

**Tech Stack:** ROS 2 Jazzy, xacro, `mujoco_ros2_control` 0.0.3, MuJoCo 3.x, Python `unittest`.

## Global Constraints

- **Scope: MuJoCo only.** Do not attempt to fix Gazebo in this plan. See the "Gazebo caveat" section — the shared-file edit may leave Gz's frame label inconsistent; that is tracked as separate work.
- **Do not modify the core description** `dual_rm_description/.../body_head_platform.urdf.xacro`. `camera_joint` stays `rpy="0 0 0"` (matches the real robot). Do **not** revert commit `9a01958`.
- **Verified fix value:** `camera_optical_joint` origin `rpy="${-pi/2} 0 ${-pi}"` yields optical bore = nav +X, right = nav −Y, down = nav −Z (a correct upright REP-103 optical frame). This was checked numerically against the measured `camera_link` orientation (`camera_link` X = `base_footprint` +Y).
- Frame/rotation convention: URDF fixed-axis rpy, `R = Rz(yaw)·Ry(pitch)·Rx(roll)`.

---

## File Structure

- `ros2_rm_robot/dual_rm_simulation/urdf/sensors/depth_camera.urdf.xacro` — **the fix.** One-line rpy change on `camera_optical_joint` + explanatory comment. Sim-only, shared by both sims.
- `r2d3_mujoco/test/test_camera_optical_frame.py` — **new** regression test. Flattens the MuJoCo robot xacro and asserts the `camera_optical_frame` bore points nav +X in `base_footprint`. Would have caught `9a01958`.
- `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-13-r2d3-urdf-unification-design.md` — correct the wrong claim that `camera_joint=0` yields an upright image.
- `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-13-r2d3-urdf-unification.md` — correct the corresponding verification step.

---

### Task 1: Regression test for the camera optical bore

**Files:**
- Test (create): `r2d3_mujoco/test/test_camera_optical_frame.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `r2d3_mujoco/urdf/r2d3_mujoco.urdf.xacro` (flattened via the `xacro` CLI), which pulls in `depth_camera.urdf.xacro`.
- Produces: nothing consumed by later tasks (a standalone guard).

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

Create `r2d3_mujoco/test/test_camera_optical_frame.py`:

```python
"""Regression guard: the camera's optical frame must bore along the robot's
nav-forward direction (base_footprint +X), upright.

The sim overlay yaws the whole mechanical tree +90deg at base_footprint_to_base
to reconcile the mesh frame with the Nav2 convention. The head-mounted camera
rides that yaw, so its optical frame carries a -90deg compensation (in the
sim-only depth_camera.urdf.xacro). If that compensation is dropped -- as it was
in commit 9a01958 -- the camera bores along base_footprint +Y and /camera/image
looks 90deg to the robot's left. This test recomputes the base_footprint ->
camera_optical_frame transform from the flattened URDF and asserts the bore.

- [ ] **Step 3: Commit the failing test**

```bash
git add r2d3_mujoco/test/test_camera_optical_frame.py
git commit -m "test(r2d3_mujoco): guard camera optical bore points nav-forward (currently red)"
```

### Task 2: Add the −90° optical-frame compensation

**Files:**
- Modify: `ros2_rm_robot/dual_rm_simulation/urdf/sensors/depth_camera.urdf.xacro:9-16`
- Test: `r2d3_mujoco/test/test_camera_optical_frame.py` (from Task 1)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: the Task 1 test.
- Produces: a `camera_optical_frame` whose bore is nav +X.

- [ ] **Step 1: Apply the fix**

In `ros2_rm_robot/dual_rm_simulation/urdf/sensors/depth_camera.urdf.xacro`, replace the optical-frame block (the `camera_optical_frame` link + `camera_optical_joint`) with:

```xml
        <!-- ── Optical frame (Z-forward, X-right, Y-down per REP-103) ── -->
        <link name="camera_optical_frame"/>
        <joint name="camera_optical_joint" type="fixed">
            <parent link="camera_link"/>
            <child link="camera_optical_frame"/>
            <!-- Body-frame (X-fwd) -> optical (Z-fwd) is the standard
                 rpy="-pi/2 0 -pi/2". The trailing yaw carries an EXTRA -pi/2
                 (net "-pi/2 0 -pi") to compensate the sim overlay's mesh->nav
                 +pi/2 yaw at base_footprint_to_base, which yaws the whole
                 mechanical tree -- including this head-mounted camera_link
                 (camera_link X = base_footprint +Y). Without it the optical
                 bore points nav +Y and the MuJoCo /camera/image looks 90 deg
                 to the robot's left. The core description's camera_joint stays
                 0 (real-faithful); this compensation is sim-only. Do NOT
                 "simplify" back to -pi/2 -- see commit 9a01958 and
                 docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-15-camera-optical-frame-yaw-fix.md. -->
            <origin xyz="0 0 0" rpy="${-pi/2} 0 ${-pi}"/>
        </joint>
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run the test to verify it passes**

Run: `cd r2d3_mujoco && python3 -m pytest test/test_camera_optical_frame.py -v`
Expected: PASS.

- [ ] **Step 3: Commit**

```bash
git add ros2_rm_robot/dual_rm_simulation/urdf/sensors/depth_camera.urdf.xacro
git commit -m "fix(sim): compensate base +90 yaw in camera optical frame (camera bores forward)

The URDF unification (9a01958) removed the camera_joint -90 hack from the
core description (correct: real robot camera_joint=0) but never re-added the
compensation in the sim overlay, so the head-mounted camera rode the
base_footprint_to_base +90 mesh->nav yaw and /camera/image looked 90 deg
left. Fold the -90 into the sim-only camera_optical_joint. MuJoCo only;
Gazebo tracked separately."
```

### Task 3: Verify the live MuJoCo camera renders forward + upright

**Files:** none (verification only).

- [ ] **Step 1: Force-regenerate the MJCF (the URDF change invalidates the cache)**

Run:
```bash
rm -rf ~/.ros/r2d3_mujoco/65b
```
The next launch reconverts automatically (checksum changed). Alternatively pass `force_recompile:=true` in Step 2.

- [ ] **Step 2: Launch and eyeball the image (realistic verification)**

Run:
```bash
ros2 launch r2d3_mujoco mujoco_sim.launch.py force_recompile:=true
# in another sourced terminal:
ros2 run rqt_image_view rqt_image_view /camera/image
```
Expected: the image is **upright** (sky up, floor down) AND looks **forward** — you see what is in front of the robot's drive direction, not the scene 90° to its left. Before the fix the same view showed the left side.

- [ ] **Step 3: (Optional) headless bore check against the regenerated MJCF**

If a MuJoCo Python install with an offscreen GL backend is available, confirm the fixed camera's world bore. Run (adjust the interpreter/`MUJOCO_GL` to your MuJoCo env):

```bash
MUJOCO_GL=egl python3 - <<'PY'
import mujoco, numpy as np
m = mujoco.MjModel.from_xml_path("/root/.ros/r2d3_mujoco/65b/mujoco_description_formatted.xml".replace("/root", __import__("os").path.expanduser("~")))
d = mujoco.MjData(m); mujoco.mj_forward(m, d)
cid = mujoco.mj_name2id(m, mujoco.mjtObj.mjOBJ_CAMERA, "camera")
R = d.cam_xmat[cid].reshape(3, 3)
print("look(-Z):", np.round(-R[:, 2], 2), " up(+Y):", np.round(R[:, 1], 2))
assert np.allclose(-R[:, 2], [1, 0, 0], atol=1e-2), "camera should look nav +X"
assert np.allclose(R[:, 1], [0, 0, 1], atol=1e-2), "camera up should be world +Z"
print("OK: camera bores nav +X, upright")
PY
```
Expected: `OK: camera bores nav +X, upright`.

- [ ] **Step 4: Confirm the pointcloud frame is consistent (no regression)**

Run (sim still up):
```bash
ros2 topic echo --once /camera/image --field header.frame_id
ros2 run tf2_ros tf2_echo base_footprint camera_optical_frame
```
Expected: `frame_id` is `camera_optical_frame`; the tf2 rotation matches an optical frame whose +Z (bore) points along `base_footprint` +X. No error output.

### Task 4: Correct the unification spec + plan docs

**Files:**
- Modify: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-13-r2d3-urdf-unification-design.md`
- Modify: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-13-r2d3-urdf-unification.md`

**Interfaces:** documentation only.

- [ ] **Step 1: Fix the spec's camera claim**

In `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-13-r2d3-urdf-unification-design.md`, find the camera row in the frame-changes table (the one describing `camera_joint` yaw `0 0 -π/2` → `0 0 0` as a "Sim-render hack ... to mask a sideways image") and the `depth_camera.urdf.xacro` row that says it is **Unchanged** because "the optical frame `(-π/2,0,-π/2)` is already correct." Replace them so they read (adjust surrounding table formatting to match):

```markdown
| `camera_joint` yaw | `0 0 -π/2` | `0 0 0` | Core description is real-faithful (real robot `camera_joint`=0). The −90° that lived here was **not** a render hack — it compensated the sim overlay's `base_footprint_to_base` +90° mesh→nav yaw. When reverting it here, the equivalent −90° MUST be re-added in the **sim overlay** (see `depth_camera.urdf.xacro` row), or the head-mounted camera bores nav +Y and `/camera/image` looks 90° left. |
```

```markdown
| `urdf/sensors/depth_camera.urdf.xacro` | `camera_optical_joint` rpy `-π/2 0 -π/2` → **`-π/2 0 -π`** — folds the −90° base-yaw compensation into the sim-only optical frame so the camera bores nav +X. |
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Fix the spec's verification claim**

In the same file, find the acceptance line stating the camera image is **upright** "with `camera_joint`=0° (no hack)" and replace it with:

```markdown
5. Camera image **upright and forward** in RViz/rqt: `camera_joint`=0° in the
   core description AND the −90° base-yaw compensation present in the sim
   overlay's `camera_optical_joint` (`-π/2 0 -π`).
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Fix the plan's camera verification step**

In `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-13-r2d3-urdf-unification.md`, find "Step 4: Verify camera image is upright" and replace its Expected note (the one saying "If it is rotated, the root cause is in the Gz camera sensor ... do not re-add the −90° to the description") with:

```markdown
Expected: image is upright AND forward-facing (you see the robot's drive
direction, not the scene 90° to its left). This requires the sim-overlay
compensation `camera_optical_joint rpy="-π/2 0 -π"` in
`dual_rm_simulation/urdf/sensors/depth_camera.urdf.xacro`. Do **not** re-add
the −90° to the core description (`camera_joint` stays 0). If MuJoCo is fixed
but Gazebo is still off, that is the known Gz sensor-convention gap — track
separately, do not change the core description.
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Commit**

```bash
git add docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-13-r2d3-urdf-unification-design.md \
        docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-13-r2d3-urdf-unification.md
git commit -m "docs: correct unification camera claim (needs sim-overlay -90 compensation)"
```

## Gazebo caveat — RESOLVED (issue #11, mount-frame fix)

The fix above edits the **shared** `depth_camera.urdf.xacro` but its scope was **MuJoCo only**. The two sims derive the camera bore differently, so Gazebo needed its own sensor-layer fix, tracked as issue #11 and now done:

- **MuJoCo** attaches its `<camera>` to the `camera_optical_frame` *site* (`mujoco_inputs.urdf.xacro:181`), so reorienting that frame fixes the render. ✅ handled above.
- **Gazebo**'s `rgbd_camera` renders along its **mounting-frame +X**;
  `gz_frame_id` only *labels* the output. After the MuJoCo fix it rendered
  nav +Y (90° left) while labeling the frame nav-forward — the inconsistency
  this caveat warned about. Fixed by re-mounting the sensor (see below).

**Gz fix (issue #11):** the sensor is mounted on the sim-only
`camera_gz_frame` — a massless fixed frame yawed −90° off `camera_link` — so
the render bores nav +X and the Gz-derived optical cloud axes match the URDF
`camera_optical_frame`. sdformat's fixed-joint lumping composes the yaw into
the SDF sensor pose on `head_link2`. Gz-only (MuJoCo ignores `<gazebo>`
blocks; the extra massless link is inert there). Note: an earlier attempt
that put the yaw in a `<pose>` inside the `<sensor>` was reverted after a
failed bringup verification and is banned per the issue #11 postmortem — the
mount frame achieves the same composed SDF without it. Guarded by
`dual_rm_simulation/test/test_gz_camera_bore.py`.

---

## Self-Review

- **Spec coverage:** Root cause (base +90° yaw uncompensated on the head camera) → Task 2 adds the −90°. Regression protection → Task 1. Live confirmation → Task 3. Doc correction (the reasoning error that caused the regression) → Task 4. Gz explicitly scoped out.
- **Placeholder scan:** none — exact rpy value, exact file, complete test code, exact commands with expected output.
- **Type consistency:** the test helper names (`_rpy_to_R`, `_joint_orientation_chain`, `_flatten_urdf`) are used consistently; the asserted value `[1,0,0]` matches the verified bore in Global Constraints and Task 2's comment.
