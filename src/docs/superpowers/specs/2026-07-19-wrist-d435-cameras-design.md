# Wrist RealSense D435 Cameras — Design

Date: 2026-07-19
Status: Approved, not yet implemented

## Goal

Add two RealSense D435 cameras to the R2D3 robot, one on each wrist, publishing
under `/left_wrist/**` and `/right_wrist/**`. The mount angle (pan/tilt) must be
adjustable so each camera can be aimed at its gripper.

Targets: **Gazebo Harmonic sim and MuJoCo sim.** Real-robot bringup is out of
scope for this spec (the real robot does carry D435s on the wrists, so the topic
layout is chosen to make that a later launch-file-only change).

## The mount

The wrist meshes already contain the camera housing — no new CAD is needed. It
is a rectangular bar on every wrist link, mirrored per arm:

| mesh              | lobe X side | center (m)              | size XYZ (m)            |
| ----------------- | ----------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------- |
| 65b `l_link6`     | +X          | `0.0664, 0, 0.0304`     | `0.024 × 0.113 × 0.037` |
| 65b `r_link6`     | −X          | `-0.0664, 0, 0.0334`    | `0.024 × 0.113 × 0.037` |
| 75b `l_link7`     | −X          | `-0.0664, 0, 0.0304`    | `0.024 × 0.113 × 0.037` |
| 75b `r_link7`     | −X          | `-0.0664, 0, 0.0388`    | `0.024 × 0.113 × 0.058` |

A D435 is 90 × 25 × 25 mm; the bar is 113 × 24 × 37 mm. The camera fits inside
it along Y with the 25 mm body matching the 24 mm bar thickness. The bar is a
D435 housing.

The camera is **contained within the bar**, not bolted to its face. The mount
frame therefore sits at the bar centroid, so pan/tilt pivot the camera in place
inside the housing rather than swinging it out through a wall.

Note the X sign is **not** a left/right rule: 65b-left is +X while 65b-right,
75b-left and 75b-right are all −X. This irregularity is stored as explicit data
(see config below), never derived from the side.

## Frame chain

Per side, defined in `dual_rm_description`:

```
<wrist link>                      l_link6 / r_link6 / l_link7 / r_link7
  └─ fixed: mount joint           xyz+rpy from YAML — hardware geometry
     {side}_wrist_camera_mount    housing centroid, nominal outward bore
       └─ fixed: aim joint        rpy = (0, tilt, pan) from YAML — the tunable
          {side}_wrist_camera_link
            ├─ {side}_wrist_camera_color_frame → ..._color_optical_frame
            └─ {side}_wrist_camera_depth_frame → ..._depth_optical_frame
```

Optical frames use the standard `rpy="-pi/2 0 -pi/2"` rotation, matching
`zed2.urdf.xacro`.

**Why two joints instead of one:** the mount joint encodes the bracket geometry
and is never edited; the aim joint is the only thing a user touches. A config
diff then shows only the aim change, and the pivot stays at the housing centroid.

## Configuration

`dual_rm_description/config/wrist_cameras.yaml`:

```yaml
# ALL ANGLES IN DEGREES (xacro converts with radians() when it reads this).
65b:
  left:  {parent: l_link6, xyz: [ 0.0671, 0, 0.0275], rpy: [0, -90, 0],   pan: 0, tilt: -45}
  right: {parent: r_link6, xyz: [-0.0671, 0, 0.0301], rpy: [0, -90, 180], pan: 0, tilt: -45}
75b:
  left:  {parent: l_link7, xyz: [-0.0671, 0, 0.0275], rpy: [0, -90, 180], pan: 0, tilt: 0}
  right: {parent: r_link7, xyz: [-0.0671, 0, 0.0256], rpy: [0, -90, 180], pan: 0, tilt: 0}
```

- `xyz` / `rpy` — the bracket: housing centroid, and the nominal bore along the
  **tool axis** (the wrist link's +Z, the direction the gripper reaches along).
- `pan` — rotation about the mount Z (left/right sweep), **degrees**.
- `tilt` — rotation about the mount Y, **degrees**. **Negative = downward**,
  toward the gripper, on both arms. Roughly `-16` centres the gripper tip.

Angles are stored in degrees because this is a knob humans turn; the xacro
converts with `radians()` at the single point where it reads the file. `xyz`
stays in metres.
- Nominal `pan: 0, tilt: 0` = camera looking straight down the tool axis, so it
  sees whatever the gripper is pointed at (arm down → floor).

> **Corrected 2026-07-20.** This section originally specified the nominal bore
> as the housing plate's outward face normal (±X), with `rpy: [0, 0, yaw]`.
> That was wrong and shipped as a bug: ±X is ~90° off the arm's reach
> direction, so the cameras looked sideways and rendered the robot when an arm
> pointed down. The fix adds the `-pi/2` pitch that swings the bore onto +Z.
> The regression test now checks the bore against the **arm's** geometry, not
> against this config — the original test compared the config with itself and
> so certified the bug. See "Lesson" at the end of this document.

Loaded in xacro via `${xacro.load_yaml(...)}`, keyed by the `arm_model` arg.

Both sims read this one file, so a single edit re-aims the camera in Gz and
MuJoCo identically.

## Files

| file                                                          | change                                                |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `dual_rm_description/urdf/sensors/d435.urdf.xacro`             | **new** — frame-only macro, sibling of `zed2.urdf.xacro` |
| `dual_rm_description/config/wrist_cameras.yaml`                | **new**                                               |
| `dual_rm_description/urdf/r2d3_description.urdf.xacro`         | instantiate both sides                                |
| `dual_rm_simulation/urdf/sensors/wrist_cams_sim.urdf.xacro`    | **new** — Gz `rgbd_camera` blocks                     |
| `dual_rm_simulation/launch/gz_sim.launch.py`                   | bridge + remap to realsense topic names               |
| `r2d3_mujoco/urdf/mujoco_inputs.urdf.xacro`                    | MJCF cameras                                          |
| `r2d3_mujoco/urdf/ros2_control/mujoco_ros2_control.urdf.xacro` | `<sensor>` tags                                       |

Frames live in the shared description so both sims inherit identical geometry;
each sim adds only its own sensor block. This is the same seam the ZED 2 uses.

The D435 macro is frame-only (no `<gazebo>` tags), so MuJoCo's converter
ignores nothing and needs no special-casing — mirroring the note already in
`r2d3_mujoco.urdf.xacro` about the ZED.

## Sensor aiming rule

**The aim comes from the URDF joint, never from a Gz `<pose>`.** This is the
issue #11 postmortem rule already documented in `zed2_sim.urdf.xacro`
("never orient a sensor with a `<pose>` — only via the frame it is mounted on").
It is what keeps the YAML as the single source of truth across both sims; a
`<pose>` override would silently desync Gz from MuJoCo.

Gz sensors mount on `{side}_wrist_camera_color_frame` with `gz_frame_id` set to
the corresponding optical frame.

## Topics

Real `realsense2_camera` layout, per side:

- `/{left,right}_wrist/color/image_raw`
- `/{left,right}_wrist/color/camera_info`
- `/{left,right}_wrist/depth/image_rect_raw`
- `/{left,right}_wrist/depth/color/points`

Chosen so a future swap to real D435s is a launch-file change with zero consumer
edits — the same reasoning behind the ZED v5 topic-contract commit (b107c79
lineage). The sim ZED layout was deliberately not mirrored: it is sim-shaped,
and these cameras have a real counterpart.

## D435 optics (sim)

- 87° horizontal FOV (`1.5184` rad)
- 848 × 480
- depth clip 0.3 – 3.0 m
- 15 Hz, matching the ZED sim update rate

## Testing

Extend the existing bore-test pattern in
`dual_rm_simulation/test/test_gz_camera_bore.py`:

1. Each wrist camera's optical frame bores along the direction the config
   specifies, for both `65b` and `75b`.
2. A nonzero `tilt` rotates the bore by exactly that amount.

Test 1 is what catches a mirrored-sign mistake that would bury a camera inside
the wrist link — the most likely failure given the irregular X signs.

## Risks — resolved during planning

1. **`xacro.load_yaml` path resolution — RESOLVED, works.** Verified that
   `$(find ...)` resolves inside `xacro.load_yaml` in this xacro version. No
   fallback needed. Note that xacro properties are lazy, so a `load_yaml` of a
   nonexistent file does *not* error until the value is used — a test that only
   defines the property proves nothing.
2. **75b `r_link7` Z discrepancy — RESOLVED, was a sampling artifact.**
   Re-measuring with the outer 4 mm face excluded shows `r_link7` is
   essentially identical to `l_link7`; the extra height came from a separate
   feature on the outermost face that the 24 mm window had swallowed. Corrected
   housing centroids (used in the config above): outer face at `|x| = 0.0783`
   on all four wrists, centroid `|x| = 0.0671`, Z = 0.0275 / 0.0301 / 0.0275 /
   0.0256 for 65b-left, 65b-right, 75b-left, 75b-right.
3. **Install-space staleness — stands.** This repo does not use
   `--symlink-install`; rebuild before trusting any launch or test result, or
   xacro will pull stale installed files.

## Implementation note discovered during planning

Never name a xacro property `e` — `e` is Euler's number in xacro's expression
namespace and gets silently redefined with a warning.


## Lesson: a test that compares a config against itself proves nothing

The nominal-bore error above survived 84 passing tests, two per-task reviews,
and a whole-branch review. It was caught only when a human pointed an arm at
the floor and saw the robot.

The reason is worth recording. The guard test was
`test_bore_points_away_from_the_wrist_axis`, and it asserted:

    dot(bore_from_config, offset_from_config) > 0

Both sides of that comparison came from `wrist_cameras.yaml`. The test could
only ever confirm that the file was internally consistent — and it was,
perfectly, while pointing every camera the wrong way. Worse, it *read* like
coverage, so each review in turn saw "bore direction: tested" and moved on. A
reviewer did flag that its docstring overclaimed, and the docstring was
softened; nobody asked the harder question of whether the assertion had any
external referent at all.

The replacement, `test_nominal_bore_follows_the_tool_axis`, asserts the bore
against the **arm's** geometry (the gripper reaches along the wrist's +Z). That
is a fact the camera config cannot influence, so the test can actually fail.

The general rule: a test whose expected value is derived from the same source
as its actual value is a tautology wearing a test's clothes. Anchor assertions
to something the code under test does not control — the arm's kinematics, a
physical measurement, a rendered frame. When a whole test suite is green and a
defect is still visible to the naked eye in one glance, suspect that the suite
is checking self-consistency rather than truth.
