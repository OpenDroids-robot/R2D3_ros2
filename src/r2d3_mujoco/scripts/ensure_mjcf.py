Cached URDF->MJCF conversion for the R2D3 MuJoCo simulation.

Hashes the xacro-generated URDF plus the world file. On a cache hit the
previously generated MJCF is published directly (skipping the expensive mesh
conversion); on a miss the upstream converter is invoked (--publish_topic pointed at
a throwaway internal topic -- see build_converter_cmd() -- so its own publish is
harmless) to save the MJCF and assets into the cache directory, this script raises the
lidar scan plane above the chassis so the rangefinder rays clear the robot body (see
raise_lidar_scan_plane()), and only then publishes the patched model on the real
--topic itself -- this script is always the one true publisher on that topic, so a
cache-miss run never lets a subscriber see the unpatched converter output.

The MJCF is published on --topic with RELIABLE + TRANSIENT_LOCAL QoS, matching
the subscriber inside mujoco_ros2_control.

# --- Lidar scan-height fix ----------------------------------------------------------
#
# The lidar is mounted low, inside the chassis body envelope: the rangefinder site sits
# at laser_link (world ~0.325, 0, 0.210 -- the real robot's measured mount), and the
# base_link_underpan / body_base_link meshes surround it, so every ray leaves the site
# and immediately re-intersects the
# chassis a few cm out -- every /scan range comes back below range_min and is reported
# as -1.0. (MuJoCo's rangefinder only excludes the site's OWN body from ray casting,
# and the converter puts the rays' site in a dedicated geometry-less
# "<site>_lidar_body", so that exclusion never covers the chassis; geomgroup filtering
# does not apply to rangefinders either -- they call mj_ray with geomgroup=NULL.)
#
# An earlier fix hid the chassis meshes from ray casting by zeroing their rgba alpha
# (the one filter ray casting honors -- ray_eliminate() in engine_ray.c). That worked
# but also hid the chassis from the renderer (alpha is a rendering property too), so the
# robot looked gutted. Instead we now RAISE the horizontal scan plane above the chassis:
# the converter's rangefinder body (laser_link_lidar_body) carries the sensor pos in its
# `pos` attribute and the ray orientation in its `quat`, so bumping its Z lifts the whole
# scan plane while keeping the rays horizontal. Verified in standalone MuJoCo: at the
# nominal height every ray self-hits the body (<0.2 m); raised by 0.15 m all 240 rays
# clear the chassis and read the world walls (~2-7 m) with the full body left visible.
#
# NOTE: laser_link is now mounted at the real robot's measured pose (0.325 0 0.210 in
# base_footprint -- see r2d3_mujoco.urdf.xacro), so the mount is no longer a placeholder.
# The raise is STILL required, though: the sim chassis mesh is solid and has no lidar
# opening cut into it, so even the correct real mount sits inside the mesh envelope
# (verified in standalone MuJoCo: at the true height all 240 rays self-hit the chassis at
# ~0.03 m; raised 0.15 m all 240 clear it and read the world walls at ~1.9-6.7 m). This
# raise can only be reduced to 0 once the chassis mesh itself models the lidar opening.

# --- Wheel collision primitives -----------------------------------------------------
#
# The R2D3 description is visual-only, so the converter synthesizes every collision geom
# as an unnamed convex HULL of the visual mesh. For the wheels this is wrong two ways:
#   1. A hull is a faceted polyhedron, not a smooth surface -- as a caster swivels its
#      ground-contact point jumps between facets, so the contact depth varies with
#      orientation (measured: one caster penetrated 19.5 mm while another floated +2 mm).
#      That inconsistency makes the base rock/wobble and the robot drive jerkily.
#   2. The hulls are not coplanar: the caster hull bottoms sit ~7-12 mm BELOW the drive
#      wheel hull bottoms, so the robot rests on the casters and the drive wheels float
#      off the ground (poor traction, nose-down tip onto the front skirt).
#
# Fix: replace the wheel collision hulls with smooth primitives, coplanar at the base
# frame's z=0 (== the ground plane). This mirrors the Gazebo model, which uses sphere
# collision for the casters (dual_rm_simulation/urdf/gazebo/sim_gazebo.urdf.xacro).
# Each wheel body's origin is its axle, so a primitive of radius == the axle's height
# above base_footprint puts its bottom at z=0; the drive-wheel radius that does this is
# also exactly the diff_drive_controller wheel_radius (0.08), so odometry stays correct.
