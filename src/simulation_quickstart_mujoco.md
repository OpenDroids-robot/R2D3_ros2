# R2D3 MuJoCo Simulation – Quick Start Guide

> **Prefer not to install ROS 2 locally?** `./droid up --mujoco` from the
> repository root runs this simulation in a container and serves the GUI to your
> browser. The image ships a pre-warmed converter venv and MJCF cache, so an
> unmodified checkout skips the cold-start conversion described below. See
> [docs/container.md](docs/container.md).

## Prerequisites

```bash
# Build the workspace
cd <your-workspace-root>          # e.g. ~/code/r2d3
colcon build
source install/setup.bash
```

> **Tip:** Always source `install/setup.bash` in every new terminal.

### Rebuild after editing — yes, every time

This workspace is built **without** `--symlink-install`, so `install/` holds
plain *copies*, not links. At runtime everything resolves through the install
space: `$(find pkg)` in a xacro, `xacro.load_yaml()` on a config, launch files,
world files, params. **Editing a file in `src/` has no effect until you
rebuild** — the sim keeps reading the previous copy.

```bash
colcon build --packages-select <pkg> && source install/setup.bash
```

This applies to plain data files too, which is the surprising part: change a
YAML, relaunch without rebuilding, and the old value is still in force with no
warning. It looks exactly like "the setting does nothing", so it tends to send
you debugging code that was never wrong. For description/config-only packages
the rebuild is ~1 s — it is only copying files.

If you would rather have live edits, `colcon build --symlink-install` links
non-compiled assets instead of copying them and removes this entirely. It is a
whole-workspace choice: mixing the two produces a confusing hybrid install
space, so switch with a clean `rm -rf build install` first, and expect every
contributor and doc to assume the same mode.

### `mujoco_ros2_control`

**Jazzy:** install the pinned binary package (already present on this machine):

```bash
sudo apt install ros-jazzy-mujoco-ros2-control
```

**Humble:** no binary package is published; build the pinned tag from source:

```bash
cd ~/ws/src
git clone -b 0.0.3 https://github.com/ros-controls/mujoco_ros2_control.git
rosdep install --from-paths mujoco_ros2_control -y --ignore-src
colcon build --packages-up-to mujoco_ros2_control
```

> **The version pin matters.** `r2d3_mujoco` targets `mujoco_ros2_control` **0.0.3**
> specifically. Newer releases move camera/lidar publishing out of the core
> hardware interface and into a separate `mujoco_ros2_control_plugins`
> package driven by its own plugins config, instead of reading the `<sensor>`
> blocks this package emits in `mujoco_inputs.urdf.xacro`. Building a newer
> tag against this package's URDF/config as-is will silently drop the
> camera and lidar.

---

## First Launch

The first time you launch (per robot model, per world), `r2d3_mujoco`
bootstraps a converter virtual environment and converts the xacro-generated
URDF into an MJCF scene. This is the slow path:

1. **venv bootstrap** (first time ever on a machine): `mujoco_ros2_control`
   creates and populates a Python venv at `~/.ros/ros2_control/.venv`. This
   can take a few minutes the very first time.
2. **URDF → MJCF conversion**: the converter does STL → OBJ conversion for
   every mesh in the robot description (32 meshes for this robot) and
   writes the result into a per-model cache directory,
   `~/.ros/r2d3_mujoco/<model>/` (e.g. `~/.ros/r2d3_mujoco/65b/`,
   `~/.ros/r2d3_mujoco/75b/`). On a machine with warm mesh/venv caches this
   takes roughly 20–30 seconds; budget several minutes for a genuinely cold
   cache. `ensure_mjcf.py` also patches the converter output to fix a lidar
   self-occlusion issue (see the Troubleshooting table) before caching it.

Every subsequent launch with the **same** xacro-generated URDF and world
file is a cache hit — `ensure_mjcf.py` logs `cache hit` and republishes the
already-patched MJCF in about a second, skipping mesh conversion entirely.

The cache is automatically invalidated (a fresh conversion is triggered)
whenever the URDF (robot model, xacro args) or the world file content
changes. To force a reconversion regardless of cache state — e.g. after
editing `mujoco_inputs.urdf.xacro` — pass `force_recompile:=true`, or
delete the cache directory outright:

```bash
ros2 launch r2d3_mujoco mujoco_sim.launch.py force_recompile:=true
# or
rm -rf ~/.ros/r2d3_mujoco
```

---

## 1. Simulation Only (MuJoCo + Controllers)

Starts the MuJoCo physics simulation, spawns the robot, and activates all
ros2_control controllers. No navigation, no MoveIt.

```bash
ros2 launch r2d3_mujoco mujoco_sim.launch.py
```

ros2 launch r2d3_mujoco mujoco_sim.launch.py robot_model:=75b headless:=true
```

### What starts

| Node / Process                | Purpose                                          |
|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `ensure_mjcf.py`                | Cached URDF→MJCF conversion; publishes `/mujoco_robot_description` |
| `robot_state_publisher`         | Publishes `/robot_description` and `/tf`          |
| `mujoco_ros2_control_node`       | Physics simulation + `controller_manager`; publishes `/scan`, `/imu`, `/zed/zed_node/*`, `/ground_truth_odom` |
| `joint_state_broadcaster`        | Publishes `/joint_states`                          |
| `diff_drive_controller`          | AGV base velocity control                          |
| `left_arm_controller`            | Left arm joint trajectory control                  |

### Teleop (manual driving)

Once the simulation is running, in a separate terminal:

```bash
ros2 run teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard \
  --ros-args -r /cmd_vel:=/diff_drive_controller/cmd_vel \
  -p stamped:=true -p frame_id:=base_footprint
```

---

## 2. Test Nodes (AGV + Arm motion verification)

Simple scripted motions to verify controllers are working.
Requires the simulation from Step 1 to be already running.

### AGV motion test

Runs a sequence: forward → stop → rotate CW → stop → backward → stop.

```bash
ros2 run r2d3_test_nodes test_agv_motion --ros-args -p use_sim_time:=true
```

### Arm motion test

Sends joint trajectory goals: left arm wave → home → right arm wave → home.

```bash
ros2 run r2d3_test_nodes test_arm_motion --ros-args -p use_sim_time:=true
```

---

## 3. Navigation / Full Stack – MuJoCo + Nav2 + MoveIt2

Starts **everything**: MuJoCo simulation, Nav2 navigation (SLAM or
localization), and — unless disabled — MoveIt2 arm planning with a combined
RViz view. Self-contained: it reuses `dual_rm_navigation`'s SLAM/Nav2
sub-launches and `r2d3_bringup`'s MoveIt/RViz configuration, but does not
depend on Gazebo at all.

```bash
ros2 launch r2d3_mujoco bringup_sim.launch.py
```

### Parameters

| Parameter        | Default                            | Description                                      |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|

| `world`             | `r2d3_mujoco/worlds/nav_empty.xml`    | Full path to the MuJoCo scene XML                  |
| `mode`              | `slam`                               | `slam` for mapping, `localization` for saved map   |
| `slam_type`         | `slam_toolbox`                       | SLAM backend: `slam_toolbox`, `rtabmap`, or `rtabmap_depth_only` |
| `map`               | *(empty)*                             | Path to map YAML (required for localization with `slam_toolbox`) |
| `use_rviz`          | `true`                                | Launch combined Nav2 + MoveIt RViz                 |
| `use_moveit`        | `true`                                | Launch MoveIt2 `move_group` for arm planning       |
| `headless`          | `false`                               | Run MuJoCo without the Simulate window             |

### Examples

```bash
# SLAM Toolbox (default) – 2D LiDAR-based mapping, full stack
ros2 launch r2d3_mujoco bringup_sim.launch.py

# RTAB-Map with RGB-D + LiDAR fusion
ros2 launch r2d3_mujoco bringup_sim.launch.py slam_type:=rtabmap

# 75b arm variant, headless (no RViz, no Simulate window — useful for CI)
ros2 launch r2d3_mujoco bringup_sim.launch.py robot_model:=75b use_rviz:=false headless:=true

# Navigation only (no arm planning)
ros2 launch r2d3_mujoco bringup_sim.launch.py use_moveit:=false

# Localization mode – navigate a previously saved map
ros2 launch r2d3_mujoco bringup_sim.launch.py mode:=localization map:=/path/to/map.yaml
```

### Save a map

While in SLAM mode, once you've explored the environment:

```bash
ros2 run nav2_map_server map_saver_cli -f ~/maps/my_map
```

### Send a navigation goal

In RViz, use the **Nav2 Goal** tool (green arrow in the toolbar) to click a
destination on the map. For MoveIt arm planning, select a planning group
(`left_arm`, `right_arm`, or `platform`) in the **MotionPlanning** panel,
drag the interactive markers, and click **Plan** then **Execute**.

## 4. Extra MuJoCo Goodies

Running under `mujoco_ros2_control` gives you a few things Gazebo doesn't
expose directly:

| Feature                 | How                                                                 |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Ground-truth base odometry | `/ground_truth_odom` — published straight from the converter-added free joint (`floating_base_joint`), independent of the diff-drive controller's estimated odometry |
| Pause / resume            | `ros2 service call /mujoco_ros2_control_node/set_pause mujoco_ros2_control_msgs/srv/SetPause "{paused: true}"` (use `paused: false` to resume) |
| Single-step (requires pause first) | `ros2 service call /mujoco_ros2_control_node/step_simulation mujoco_ros2_control_msgs/srv/StepSimulation "{steps: 10}"` |
| Reset the world           | `ros2 service call /mujoco_ros2_control_node/reset_world mujoco_ros2_control_msgs/srv/ResetWorld "{keyframe: ''}"` |
| Interactive Simulate window | Omit `headless:=true` (or set it `false`, the default) to get the MuJoCo Simulate GUI. **Space** pauses/resumes; **→** single-steps while paused. |

## Aiming the wrist cameras

Each wrist carries a RealSense D435 publishing under `/left_wrist/**` and
`/right_wrist/**` (`color/image_raw`, `color/camera_info`,
`depth/image_rect_raw`, `depth/color/points`).

Aim is set in one place, read by both sims:

```
ros2_rm_robot/dual_rm_description/dual_rm_description/config/wrist_cameras.yaml
```

Per arm variant (`65b` / `75b`) and side:

- `tilt` — **degrees** about the mount Y. **Negative tilts the camera down**
  toward the gripper. This is usually the only value you need.
- `pan` — **degrees** about the mount Z (left/right sweep).

All angles in that file are degrees; the xacro converts to radians at the one
point where it reads the file.
- `xyz` / `rpy` — the physical housing pose. These describe the bracket in the
  wrist mesh; leave them alone unless the hardware changes.

`pan: 0, tilt: 0` is the camera looking straight down the tool axis (the
wrist's +Z, the direction the gripper reaches along) — so it sees whatever the
gripper is pointed at, and an arm pointing down sees the floor. Roughly
`tilt: -16` centres the gripper tip in frame; `-45` angles it well across the
gripper.

> **An edit here does nothing until you rebuild.** This workspace does not use
> `--symlink-install`, so `$(find ...)` resolves to the *install* space and
> xacro keeps reading the previous copy of the file. If a tilt change appears
> to have no effect, this is almost certainly why — rebuild and relaunch.

Rebuild after editing — this workspace does not use `--symlink-install`, so
xacro reads the installed copy:

```bash
colcon build --packages-select dual_rm_description && source install/setup.bash
```

> **MuJoCo-specific:** the wrist `depth/color/points` clouds run through
> `depth_image_proc` with `approximate_sync` enabled. MuJoCo does not stamp
> colour and depth frames bit-identically, so the default exact-time
> synchronizer starves — it dropped roughly 85–90% of frames before
> `approximate_sync` was turned on. The trade-off: colour and depth can be
> paired from slightly different instants, so a fast-moving arm may show
> some edge misalignment ("smearing") in the cloud. That is an accepted
> trade-off of the sync policy, not a bug.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| venv bootstrap slow, hangs, or fails | Corrupted/incomplete `mujoco_ros2_control` converter venv | Delete `~/.ros/ros2_control/.venv` and relaunch — it rebuilds from scratch |
| Launch fails at conversion with a `patch count` ERROR | The converter's generated MJCF no longer matches `ensure_mjcf.py`'s lidar-visibility patterns (upstream `mujoco_ros2_control` version change, renamed chassis meshes, resized lidar housing, etc.) — this is a **hard failure by design**: publishing an unpatched model would silently resurrect the all-`-1.0` `/scan` bug | Inspect the cached `mujoco_description_formatted.xml` and update the matching patterns in `patch_lidar_housing_visibility()` (`r2d3_mujoco/scripts/ensure_mjcf.py`) |
| Stale / wrong-looking simulation after editing xacros | Cache hit is reusing an old MJCF because the checksum still matches (e.g. you edited a file the checksum doesn't cover) | Delete `~/.ros/r2d3_mujoco/` or relaunch with `force_recompile:=true` |
| `/zed/zed_node/point_cloud/cloud_registered` never publishes, but everything else works | `depth_image_proc` isn't installed — `zed_points_container` fails to load the `PointCloudXyzrgbNode` component (`Could not find requested resource in ament index` in the log), but this failure doesn't affect any other node | `sudo apt install ros-$ROS_DISTRO-depth-image-proc`, then relaunch |
| `/joint_states` / `/imu` publish slower than expected (e.g. ~55 Hz instead of the configured 100 Hz) | The machine can't keep the MuJoCo physics step running at real-time; sensor publish rates drop proportionally to the achieved sim rate | Not a config error — expected on slower/loaded machines. Reduce other load, or treat published rates as approximate |
| EGL / GLFW errors when the camera renders (e.g. `libEGL warning`, `Failed to create OpenGL context`) | Headless GPU / software-rendering driver quirks | Usually harmless — camera rendering still works via software fallback; if it doesn't, try `headless:=true` to skip the interactive Simulate window (camera rendering is independent of it) |
| `~/robot_description` service errors on Humble | Humble's `controller_manager` expects a `~/robot_description` topic remap that Jazzy doesn't need | Already handled automatically — `mujoco_sim.launch.py` adds the `~/robot_description -> /robot_description` remap only when `ROS_DISTRO=humble` |
| `ros2 topic hz` on a camera topic reports an implausibly high or noisy rate | Stale simulator/bridge processes from an earlier session survived a naive `pkill` and are duplicate-publishing onto the same topic name; `ros2 topic hz` silently aggregates across all publishers | Check publisher count first with `ros2 topic info -v <topic>`; if more than one, find and kill the stragglers with `pgrep -af 'mujoco\|gz sim\|ros_gz_bridge\|ruby\|component_container'` |
| Wheels slip / robot drifts off a straight line | Contact friction / solver tuning | Tunable in `r2d3_mujoco/urdf/mujoco_inputs.urdf.xacro`: the shared `collision` default class's `friction`/`condim`, and `<option noslip_iterations="...">` |
| Underpan / chassis pan looks invisible in RViz's camera image or in the Simulate window | **Intentional.** The lidar mounts flush against the chassis pan (`base_link_underpan`, `body_base_link`); `ensure_mjcf.py` zeroes their rgba alpha so the lidar's own rays don't self-occlude. Alpha is a rendering property too, so this also hides them from the RGB/depth camera. The camera looks outward/forward and doesn't normally frame the underpan, so this is accepted as a cosmetic trade-off, not a bug | None needed; if camera-visible chassis geometry is ever required, it needs per-consumer geom duplication upstream (out of scope for this package) |
| `right_arm_controller` / `left_arm_controller` stay `inactive` on the **75b** (7-DOF) variant, with `Unable to activate controller ... command interface 'l_joint7/position'/'r_joint7/position' is not available` | `l_joint7`/`r_joint7` are present in the generated URDF's `<ros2_control>` block and in the converted MJCF's actuator list, but `mujoco_ros2_control` 0.0.3's URDF parsing does not export a `command_interface` for either — reproduced consistently on both cache-miss and cache-hit launches. `joint_state_broadcaster`, `diff_drive_controller`, `platform_controller`, and `imu_sensor_broadcaster` are unaffected | Known upstream limitation of `mujoco_ros2_control` 0.0.3 with a 7-joint-per-arm `<ros2_control>` block; not fixable from `r2d3_mujoco/` files. The 65b (6-DOF) variant is unaffected — use it if full arm control is required today |
