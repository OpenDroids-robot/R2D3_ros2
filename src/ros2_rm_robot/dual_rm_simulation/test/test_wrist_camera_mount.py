"""Guards the wrist D435 mount frames against the two mistakes this geometry
invites.

1. MIRRORED SIGN. The housing X offset is not a left/right rule: 65b-left sits
   at +X while 65b-right, 75b-left and 75b-right all sit at -X. Deriving the
   sign from the side instead of reading it from the config buries a camera
   inside its own wrist link, where it renders the link interior and looks
   merely "dark" rather than obviously broken.
2. AIM APPLIED AT THE WRONG PIVOT. pan/tilt must rotate about the housing
   centroid. If the aim joint is folded into the mount joint, tilting also
   translates the camera out through the housing wall.

The mount pose is asserted against config/wrist_cameras.yaml itself, so the
YAML stays the single source of truth: editing it cannot silently drift from
what the URDF builds.

NOTE: the xacro include resolves via $(find ...) -> the INSTALL space.
Rebuild (colcon build --packages-select dual_rm_description
dual_rm_simulation) after editing xacros or the YAML, or this test sees old
files.
