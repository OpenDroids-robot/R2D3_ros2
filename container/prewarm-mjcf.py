"""Pre-warm the MuJoCo URDF->MJCF cache under the EXACT key `mujoco_sim.launch.py`
will look up at runtime, and fail the image build if it is not.

Why this is a Python driver and not a few lines of shell
--------------------------------------------------------
The cache is content-addressed over the xacro-generated robot description
(`ensure_mjcf.compute_checksum(description, world_text, CONVERTER_ARGS_VERSION)`),
so the pre-warm is a HIT only if the description it hands the converter is
byte-identical to the one the launch file hands it. Two things kept breaking that,
both silently -- the cache still existed, so every build-time assertion still
passed, and the only symptom was a slow first launch:

  1. `description="$(xacro ...)"` in bash. Command substitution strips ALL trailing
     newlines, so the description ended `</robot>`. `launch.substitutions.Command`
     returns `subprocess.run(..., stdout=PIPE, universal_newlines=True).stdout`
     with no strip at all, so the launch's description ends `</robot>\\n`. One byte,
     a completely different sha256, a guaranteed miss. Measured in the shipped
     image: 73510 bytes vs 73511, checksum 33f7ba16... vs 2c302a63... . This file
     therefore uses the real `Command` substitution object; there is no shell
     anywhere in the path that produces the description.

  2. The launch file's argument defaults were hand-copied into the Dockerfile.
     Change `robot_model`, `world` or `headless` in the launch file and the
     pre-warm quietly warms a key nobody asks for. This file reads the defaults
     out of the launch file's own `DeclareLaunchArgument` entities instead.

The final assertion catches both of those, plus a `CONVERTER_ARGS_VERSION` bump, a
changed world file, or a stale/foreign checksum left on disk: the checksum
recomputed from the launch-form description MUST equal the checksum file the
converter wrote. If it does not, the layer fails loudly rather than shipping an
image whose "pre-warmed" cache is dead weight.

What it CANNOT catch: `expected` and `stored` both derive from the SAME
`description` string built two lines above by `launch_form_robot_description()`,
which hand-composes the xacro arguments (`arm_model:=`, `headless:=`) rather than
reading them off `mujoco_sim.launch.py`'s `Command([...])`. If someone ADDS an
xacro argument to that `Command([...])` (or renames one side's `name:=` mapping),
this driver keeps building only the old argument list, converts it, stores its
checksum, and the assertion passes -- comparing the driver against itself, not
against the launch file. The image then ships a pre-warm under a key the launch
will never ask for, silently. That drift is caught elsewhere, not here: see
`TestPrewarmXacroArgsMatchLaunchFile` in
`container/test/test_container_config.py`, which parses both `Command([...])`
argument lists and asserts they match.

Why it drives `ensure_mjcf.py` directly instead of running the launch file
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
`headless` is an argument to the xacro, not just a runtime flag, so passing
`headless:=true` to dodge the MuJoCo window would itself change the description
and therefore the cache key. With the real default (`false`) the launch brings up
`mujoco_ros2_control`, which wants a display no build layer has. Driving the
converter directly with the launch's own defaults warms the right key with none of
that. It also skips `controller_manager`, six spawners and three composable
containers, none of which contribute to the cache.

The converter is invoked as the installed script rather than through `ros2 run`:
`ros2 run` Popen()s the script as a child, so the PID we hold would be the
launcher and SIGTERM would stop the wrong process. `ensure_mjcf.py` restores
default signal handling before it latches the model and spins, so SIGTERM ends it
cleanly once the cache is on disk.
