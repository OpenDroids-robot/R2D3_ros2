# devcontainer.json `postCreateCommand`: runs INSIDE the dev container, once per
# container creation, as the remote user (droid), from the workspace folder.
#
# 1. Make every integrated terminal a ROS shell: source /opt/ros/jazzy and the
#    workspace install space from ~/.bashrc. ~/.bashrc is container-local (the
#    home directory is not a volume), so this is re-applied on every rebuild
#    and never leaks onto the host.
#
# 2. Build the simulation subset, exactly as every `./droid up` launch path
#    does before launching: plain `colcon build`, no --symlink-install, scoped
#    by the image's /etc/colcon/defaults.yaml. install/ is plain copies, so an
#    edit under src/ does not exist until a rebuild copies it -- the same trap
#    as on the host (see CLAUDE.md). This first build populates the shared
#    install volume on a fresh clone; later rebuilds are on you:
#    `colcon build --packages-select <pkg>` from /ws.
